# MusicInfoApp
This Tkinter GUI application (still in development) uses the Deezer API (https://rapidapi.com/deezerdevs/api/deezer-1/) to display information about a specific song or artist whose name is entered by the user.

## Features

### Song
If you enter the name of a song into the Song Title entry box and press the arrow button next to it, you will see information (title, artist, album title, release date, genre, duration, and label) about the top-rated track on Deezer that corresponds to that search result. (If the song wasn't what you were looking for, you can write more keywords into the box.)

### Artist
If you enter the name of an artist into the Artist box and press the corresponding arrow button, you will see information (name, number of albums released, and the title of their top-rated track on Deezer) about the artist of the song that appears at the top of the search results for that name. (Note that this will also work if you add keywords, in case you did not find the artist you were looking for the first time.)
